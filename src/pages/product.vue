        <h1>Product Liability</h1>
        <p>  Bringing exported products together with buyers in different cultures and new countries with different usage habits may involve many unforeseen risks. There may be local laws and product standards, and the high consumption awareness of the residents of the relevant country and the habit of choosing to sue when they have problems with defective products may complicate the current situation.
          In such undesirable situations, the producer may be faced with a local legislation of which he has limited knowledge.
        </p>
        <p> As can be seen, an insurance policy can be a real guarantee that will enable the company to continue its activities at the time of the realization of the risk, as well as minimizing the loss of reputation. It can be an important solution for both the consumer and the manufacturer who does not want to lose their financial power and reputation, with the global circulation of the products, which has become extremely complicated due to the responsibility of each business in the supply chain for the final product from the raw material producer.

        </p>
        <p>
          Consciousness of consumption differs in parallel with the development and education levels of the countries, and the demand for product liability policies also increases in developed countries due to the conscious consumer and high product standard conditions.
        </p>
        <p>According to the demand of the insured, the product to be insured can be expanded in terms of coverage and strengthened with sub-guarantees, making it more secure.</p>
