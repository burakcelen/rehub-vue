        <h1>Property</h1>
        <p> Property risks span a wide spectrum, from building damage caused by a fire, to natural catastrophes, to supply chain disruptions. Any of these and a multitude of other property-triggered business interruption (BI) incidents may present a worst-case loss scenario, so it's important to have a robust plan in place to minimize exposures and recover quickly.
        </p>
        <p>We help you understand and manage these risks, allowing you to focus on whatâ€™s most important: your business. We take a holistic view of your full spectrum of property and BI risks and help you build a strong foundation for driving down your total cost of risk and improving resilience.
